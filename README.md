# Sankey
Overview

A sankey diagram is a visualization used to depict a flow from one set of values to another. The things being connected are called nodes and the connections are called links. Sankeys are best used when you want to show a many-to-many mapping between two domains (e.g., universities and majors) or multiple paths through a set of stages (for instance, Google Analytics uses sankeys to show how traffic flows from pages to other pages on your web site).

For the curious, they're named after Captain Sankey, who created a diagram of steam engine efficiency that used arrows having widths proportional to heat loss.

ðŸ“Š Over the past 6 weeks, I tracked every job application I submittedâ€”385 in total. I wanted to visualize not just how many I sent out, but where they went, what responses I got, and how far each application progressed.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown visualized in a Sankey diagram:

Applications sent: 385

Channels used: LinkedIn (157), Email (71), Indeed (65), Company Sites (53), Misc (27), Networking (12)

First interviews: 35

Second interviews: 7

Offers: 1

ðŸ’¥ Key Insights:

LinkedIn had the highest volume but also the highest rejection/ghosting rate.

Networking, while the smallest in volume, had the best success rate per application.

Reaching the first interview stage was a steep drop-off, highlighting how competitive early career roles can be.

ðŸ“ˆ Why I did this:
Job hunting can feel like shouting into a void. Visualizing the process gave me clarity, focus, and renewed motivation. It also helped me double down on the channels that actually led to interviews.

If you're in the job hunt right now, track everything. Then analyze. Iterate. Improve.
